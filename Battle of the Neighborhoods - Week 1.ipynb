    "The idea of this study is to clearly settle, once and for all, which city is best: San Francisco or New York City. I will frame this study by exploring which city gives \"more bang for your buck\". I will answer this question by comparing median rent prices of neighborhoods in each city (the buck), and venues that reside in these neighborhoods (the bang). This study will give clarity to individuals in both cities that are considering moving to the other. Additionally, it will inform current residents of San Francisco and New York City, of other neighborhoods within their own city they could potentially move to whether they want to pay less in rent or live near certain venues. Examples of this could be a family wanting to move to an area with more parks and playgrounds, a coffee enthusiast wanting to live near the most coffee shops as possible, or your average person looking to pay less rent in a neighborhood comparable to their current one."

Similar to the Toronto project, I will use this data to visualize maps using Folium."
